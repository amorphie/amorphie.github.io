# Definition
In OAuth 2.0, a flow (also known as a grant type or authorization flow) defines the sequence of steps and interactions between the various parties involved in the authorization process. The flow determines how an OAuth client obtains authorization from a resource owner (user) and receives an access token to access protected resources.

The purpose of flows in OAuth 2.0 is to provide different mechanisms for client applications to authenticate and obtain authorization, ensuring the security and privacy of user data. The choice of flow depends on the type of client, the level of trust, and the specific requirements of the application.

OAuth 2.0 defines several standard flows/grant types to accommodate different application scenarios:

1. Authorization Code Flow (aka Web Server Flow):
- Used by server-side web applications.
- The client exchanges an authorization code for an access token.
- Typically involves redirection and user interaction through the user's web browser.

2. Implicit Flow (aka Browser-Based or Client-Side Flow):
- Used by JavaScript-based applications or mobile apps.
- The client obtains an access token directly from the authorization endpoint.
- Designed for environments where the client application cannot keep a client secret securely.

3. Resource Owner Password Credentials Flow:
- Used when the client application has direct access to the resource owner's credentials (username and password).
- The client directly sends the credentials to the authorization server to obtain an access token.
- Requires a high level of trust between the client and the authorization server.

4. Client Credentials Flow:
- Used when the client application is acting on its own behalf (not on behalf of a resource owner).
- The client directly sends its own credentials (client ID and client secret) to the authorization server to obtain an access token.

5. Refresh Token Flow:
- Used to obtain a new access token when the original token expires.
- The client sends a refresh token to the authorization server to obtain a new access token, without requiring user interaction.
- The choice of flow depends on factors such as the type of client application, the level of trust between the client and the authorization server, the platform limitations, and the desired user experience.

Each flow has its own security characteristics and suitability for different scenarios. It is essential to carefully select and implement the appropriate flow to ensure the security and integrity of the authorization process and protect user data.
